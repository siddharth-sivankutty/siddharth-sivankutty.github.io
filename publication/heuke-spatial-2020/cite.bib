 abstract = {For sparse samples or in the presence of ambient light, the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) performance of single-point-scanning coherent anti-Stokes Raman scattering (CARS) images is not optimized. As an improvement, we propose replacing the conventional CARS focus-point illumination with a periodically structured focus line while continuing to collect the transmitted CARS intensity on a single detector. The object information along the illuminated line is obtained by numerically processing the CARS signal recorded for various periods of the structured focus line. We demonstrate experimentally the feasibility of this spatial frequency modulated imaging (SPIFI) in CARS (SPIFI-CARS) and SHG (SPIFI-SHG) and identify situations where its SNR is better than that of the single-point-scanning approach.},
